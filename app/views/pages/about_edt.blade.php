<h2>What is the EDT?</h2>

<p>The Editorial, Design and Translation Team (EDT) is a group of trained and qualified editors, designers  and translators who offer a number of professional editorial, graphic design  and translation services to the Fipra Network.</p>
<p>The EDT ensures that all Fipra's written and presentational output including e-mails, letters, proposals, PowerPoint presentations, reports, monitors, booklets, newsletters, websites and more:</p>

<ul class="square">
    <li>have a polished, professional and finished look;</li>
    <li>have consistent English language grammar;</li>
    <li>adhere to the Fipra Editorial and Style Guidelines;</li>
    <li>are perceived externally as being of consistently high quality;</li>
    <li>are translated correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>We would like all Fipra Units, Correspondents and Special Advisers to embrace this cost-effective resource by using the EDT's full range of editorial, graphic design and translation capabilities. The EDT is also at your disposal for output that is not Fipra branded: for example, for your local brand or the branding of a client.</p>
